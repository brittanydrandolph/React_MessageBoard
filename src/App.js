  // best practice and required when using typescript because if an array is
  // potentially undefined because the component will load faster than a DB
  // will fetch the data for it, than it will try and execute the map function
  // on an undefined variable and that will crash.  The and is a a little quick
  // type coersion that requires the presence of comments to be truthy in order
  // to then execute the map function on it -- you will see this a lot in 
  // javascript :)
